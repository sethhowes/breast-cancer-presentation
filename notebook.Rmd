```{r}
path <- dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)
setwd(path)
```
```{r}
breast_cancer <- readRDS("metabric-analytical.rds")
head(breast_cancer)
```

I want to assess what the different cancer types are
```{r}
unique(breast_cancer$cancer_type)
sum(is.na(breast_cancer$cancer_type == "NA"))
```
I want to assess whether there are any cancers with 
```{r}
sum(breast_cancer$tumor_stage == 0, na.rm=TRUE)
```

# Aim 2: How does molecular signature influence survival
```{r}
breast_cancer <- breast_cancer %>%
  mutate(
    overall_status = ifelse(vital_status == "died of disease", "dead", "censored")
  ) %>%
  drop_na(overall_status)
```
